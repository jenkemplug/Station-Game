Derelict Station â€” Expanded Survival (single-file prototype)

How to run
- The easiest way is to open `game.html` in your browser.
- For best behavior (localStorage + fetch), run a simple local HTTP server in the project directory.

Using PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
# with Python
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/game.html in your browser
```

or with Node (if installed):

```powershell
npx serve -p 8000 .
# then open http://localhost:8000/game.html
```
